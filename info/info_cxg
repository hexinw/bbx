1. Use boost intrusive list over std::list
2. std::atomic not supporting 128 bits.
3. STL missing spinlock implementation.
   spinlock uses PAUSE instruction for optimal CPU sleep.
4. Custom shared_ptr allocator to allocate/deallocate from a memory pool
   in lock-free scheme.
5. Compare-and-Swap used to implement a lock-free buffer.
