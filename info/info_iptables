**Chain Traversal Order:

Assuming that the server knows how to route a packet and that the firewall
rules permit its transmission, the following flows represent the paths that
will be traversed in different situations:

 -. Incoming packets destined for the local system: PREROUTING -> INPUT
 -. Incoming packets destined to another host: PREROUTING -> FORWARD -> POSTROUTING
 -. Locally generated packets: OUTPUT -> POSTROUTING
